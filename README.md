Bicycle-computer-
=================
This is Version 1
There are revisions coming up which will include Bluetooth BLE shield code for ios and mac and XBee to communicate from under the wheel to the LCD. 
I have two arduinos, one to receive data from the reed swtich on the back wheel and the other on the handlebars with the LCD. This is because 
I eventually plan to have bluetooth and XBees but have not gotten them on the bicycle computer yet.
if you have questions a tutorial of how to mount and build this cycle computer will be posted on instructables soon.

This code is written for arduino 1.0.1, NOT for 1.0.5. I hope to get a code for 1.0.5 soon
